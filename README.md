# Helicopter Prison Breaks EDA Project

## The Great Escape

Welcome to my exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on prison breaks. My goal is to gain insights into the intriguing phenomenon of helicopter prison breaks by analyzing real-world data.

In this project, I will focus on analyzing data related to helicopter prison breaks. I will be obtaining the data from Wikipedia, which is a comprehensive source of information on this topic. It's important to note that the data may be subject to updates, and as such, my findings may differ from future analyses.

By conducting this analysis, I hope to not only uncover interesting patterns and trends but also hone my skills in data preparation and analysis using Python. This project serves as my first portfolio piece in Jupyter Notebook, which allows me to showcase my code and effectively communicate my findings.

## Project Overview

During my exploratory data analysis, I will seek to answer some crucial questions regarding helicopter prison breaks. Specifically, I will examine which year had the highest number of attempted helicopter prison breaks and which countries experienced the most attempts. Additionally, I will investigate whether certain inmates tried to escape more than once and determine what percentage of them successfully escaped. By answering these questions, I hope to gain deeper insights into this fascinating phenomenon and develop a comprehensive understanding of the data.

## Technical Details

The analysis is performed using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. All code and visualizations can be found in the Helicopter prison break.ipynb file in this repository.

## Conclusion

Please join me on this exciting journey as I dive into the data and uncover new insights. I hope you find this project informative, engaging, and entertaining!
